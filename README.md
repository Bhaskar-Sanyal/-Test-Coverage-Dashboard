# -Test-Coverage-Dashboard
A Python-based dashboard to visualize and analyze test coverage reports. It integrates coverage.py and pytest to generate coverage data, uses matplotlib for visualizations, and provides an interactive Flask or Streamlit UI to monitor codebase test coverage efficiently.
 Test Coverage Dashboard
 Objective: Analyze codebase test coverage visually.
 Tools: coverage.py, pytest, matplotlib
 Mini Guide:
 1.Clone Python repo and write tests.
 2.Run coverage and generate report.
 3.Parse data into usable format.
 4.Plot visuals (coverage % by file).
 5.Highlight uncovered files.
 6.Display results in Flask/Streamlit UI.
 Deliverables: Coverage reports, visual dashboard, sample repo
